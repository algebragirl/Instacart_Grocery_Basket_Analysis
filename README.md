# **Instacart_Grocery_Basket_Analysis (Python)**
## **Objective**
I'm an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover 
more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest
strategies for better segmentaion based on the provided criteria.

## **Key Questions**
-The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times 
 when there are fewer orders.

-They also want to know whether there are particulart times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these 
 times.

-Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

-Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product 
 orders.

-The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
 1. What's the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
 2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customr's loyaltty status?
 3. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
 4. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
 5. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Cerain types of goods? Family status?
 6. What diferences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are 
    ordering, and anything els you can think of.

## **Data**
Original datasets used for this  project:

- Customers
- Orders
- Orders_products_prior
- Products
- Departments

## **Tools**
The data was analyzed using the following Python libraries:

- pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- os: included automatically with Python; supports functions for interacting with the operating system of your device
- seaborn: for data visualizations
- matplotlib: for data visualizations
- scipy: for data visualizations

## **Folders**
The project files are stored in the following folders:

- 01 'Project Management': Project brief
- 02 'Data': Contains 2 subfolders - 'Original' and 'Prepared'; 'Original' contains the original data set. 'Prepared' contains data after it has been cleaned.
            Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations
- 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: The 'Visualizations' folder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel

## **Disclaimer**
Note: Instacart is a real company that's made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
