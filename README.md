# **Objective**
I'm an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover 
more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest
strategies for better segmentaion based on the provided criteria.

# **Key Questions**
-The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

-They also want to know whether there are particulart times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
