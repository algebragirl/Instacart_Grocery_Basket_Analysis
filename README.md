# Objective
I'm an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover 
more information about their sales patterns. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest
strategies for better segmentaion based on the provided criteria.
